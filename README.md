Welcome to the 
Revit Essentials for Architecture: 2021 and beyond

Dataset Files Package 

*************************************************

The Dataset comes in two WinZip Self-extracting Archives.

AARAC_7ed_I.exe -- contains all of the imperial Units datasets.
AARAC_7ed_M.exe -- contains all of the metric Units datasets.

Free hard drive space required: approximately 1.7 GB. If you plan to download both the imperial and the metric dataset, you will need twice this amount. 

Windows Security
*************************************************
If you get a security warning from Windows when executing the WinZip EXE file, please click the "Yes" or "Allow" button to extract the files. 

Choose your Unit Preference
*************************************************
You only need to install one of the datasets. Choose the one corresponding to your preferred units. If you wish to perform the exercises in both imperial and metric, you can install both datasets. 

Software Version
*************************************************
The files in both the metric and imperial datasets are saved in the Revit 2021 file format. You must have your own copy of Revit 2021 or Revit LT 2021 (or later) installed on your system to open the files. If you are installing this for use with a version later than 2021, the files will upgrade automatically when you open them. (If you are attempting to open with a version prior to 2021, the files are incompatible and will fail to open. (Please visit www.paulaubin.com to learn how you can purchase a copy of an older edition of this book).

Revit is NOT included
*************************************************
***The Dataset files archives DO NOT include a copy of the Revit software. Contact your Autodesk reseller if you need to purchase a copy.***

Installation Location
*************************************************
Files default to your C Drive in a folder called: "REA_8ed_I" for imperial units and "REA_8ed_M" for metric units. You are free to choose a different location, such as your Documents folder, to install the files. Simply click the Browse button before unzipping the files to choose your preferred location. 

Folder Structure
*************************************************
The following Folder Structure will be created

Within most of the "Chapter" folders is a "Complete" folder. This folder contains the finished version of the dataset as it should look at the completion of the chapter. Use it to compare your work to the intended result. 
    
Empty Folders
*************************************************
Some folders have been left empty intentionally. For example, the Chapter03 is empty and contains a single text file explaining that it intentionally contains no dataset files.

Cleaning up Revit Backup Files
*************************************************
A Windows Batch file named: BackupCleanup.bat is provided at the root of the dataset folder. Double-click this file to run a cleanup routine. All Revit backup files in the folder and all subfolders will be deleted. Backup files have a four number extension appended to their name such as: .0001. You do not need to delete backup files. Do so only to free up hard drive space and only after you are sure you have created regular backups of important project work. If you choose not to delete these backup files, you can use them to restore a previous version of your Revit project files. To "restore" a backup file in Revit, simply open it and then save as. By default, Revit will save the previous three versions of a file as you work. The BAT file provided here is intended to help you cleanup when you complete a chapter. Use is at your discretion. 


Installing Individual Chapters
*************************************************
There is no mechanism provided to install a single Chapter. If you do not intend to complete the tutorials for a particular Chapter, simply delete that chapter's folder after installation. 

If you do decide to delete some chapters, you may want to keep Chapter18 even if you do not intend to complete that chapter. This is because this folder contains the final version of both projects completed throughout the book. Use this project to view the completed projects and compare your progress and/or plot the drawing sets. 

Templates Folder
*************************************************
This folder contains the out-of-the-box template projects referenced in the book's lessons. If you do not have the default templates installed in the typical locations as noted in the text, you can use the copies in this folder instead. Please do not delete this folder. 

Links Folder
*************************************************
This folder contains a few projects that are linked to several other chapters starting with Chapter 8. Please do not delete this folder.
